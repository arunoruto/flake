Use conventional commits style:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

1. fix: a commit of the type fix patches a bug in your codebase (this correlates with PATCH in Semantic Versioning).
2. feat: a commit of the type feat introduces a new feature to the codebase (this correlates with MINOR in Semantic Versioning).
3. BREAKING CHANGE: a commit that has a footer BREAKING CHANGE:, or appends a ! after the type/scope, introduces a breaking API change (correlating with MAJOR in Semantic Versioning). A BREAKING CHANGE can be part of commits of any type.
4. types other than fix: and feat: are allowed, for example @commitlint/config-conventional (based on the Angular convention) recommends build:, chore:, ci:, docs:, style:, refactor:, perf:, test:, and others.
5. footers other than BREAKING CHANGE: <description> may be provided and follow a convention similar to git trailer format.

Please could you write a commit message for my changes.
Only respond with the commit message. Don't give any notes.
Explain what were the changes and why the changes were done.
Focus the most important changes.
Use the present tense.
Use a semantic commit prefix.
Hard wrap lines at 72 characters.
Ensure the title is only 50 characters.
Do not start any lines with the hash symbol.
